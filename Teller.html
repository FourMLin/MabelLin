                The highlight of Royal College of Art Service Design MA term 1 is the three-month-long comprehensive
                service design project. Aegon is the pension provider as our collaborator and adviser. They require
                fresh ideas from us to increase the amount of people engage in pension saving and how to modify this
                behavior with sustainability.

                <b>Decoding Global Pension Systems Through Local Insight</b><br>
                By comparing the UK and Taiwan‚Äôs pension frameworks, I explored how financial products like "THE pension
                companies" shape retirement planning across cultures. Translating complex policy into accessible
                knowledge, I helped the team navigate unfamiliar systems with clarity‚Äîbridging global finance with
                design strategy.
                <br>
                <b>Designing a Human-Centered Cycle of Financial Wellbeing</b><br>
                Through interviews with local residents, I gathered diverse perspectives on saving habits and distilled
                them into a practical benefit cycle. This user-informed loop became a foundation for aligning policy
                thinking with real-world needs‚Äîconnecting social insight to actionable design.

          <h3>1. Research</h3>
          <p>
            As a Taiwanese, I‚Äôm surprise that pension statements are quite different. In the UK, the National pension
            and workplace pensions are calculated separately. Typically, residents who pay taxes regularly are provided
            with a dedicated account by the government. Pension generated from National Insurance base on the rate of
            contribution (similar to Taiwan‚Äôs labor pension).

          <p>
            Pension providers not only manage pensions but also offer wealth management service. People can invest in
            various funds such as the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) financial products through them.

          <p>
            On the policy and economic front, data shows that the returns on green investments now exceed those of
            traditional investment projects. These investments are regulated for financial transparency by the Financial
            Conduct Authority (FCA).

          <p>
            Reducing carbon footprints has always been a strategy that nations are committed to improving climate
            change. Although, carbon credit policies are in starting stage, there will soon be a complete set of
            measures to restrict industries and people from reducing carbon emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of policies and economics, green funds prove to be more profitable than traditional investments, a
            fact reinforced by the regular oversight of fiscal transparency by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

            Most people know what ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù means but are unsure what to do. They are unable to care about the
            future arc of the impact of carbon footprint on climate change. Although policies have been introduced one
            after another, they have never attracted the attention of the general public.

            According to data provided by local retirement agencies and insurance companies, people usually start
            retirement plans at the age of 36 which falls squarely within the category of the Millennial generation
            (30‚Äì39 years old).

            We‚Äôve identified some of the main reasons why people are reluctant to plan for retirement:

          <h4>Interview</h4>
          <p>
            We focused our interviews on high-potential Millennial's, whom research shows are those who have work
            experience, have retirement accounts and are likely to continue working for more than 25 years. We asked
            more than ten Millennial's to share their experiences and selected five to conduct an in-depth survey of
            their behaviors and thoughts.

            After having the above survey data, we started brainstorming, collecting everyone‚Äôs opinions, rating the

            <h4>Our Service Process</h4>
            <p>
              Teller uses Round-up to allow consumers to round up the payment price difference when consuming and put
              the price difference into their pension account. For example, if a consumer buys a cup of coffee for ¬£2.5,
              the payment will be ¬£3, and the extra ¬£0.5 will be Put it into your retirement account as a pension.
            </p>
            <p>
              We limit this function to only stores that are beneficial to climate change. By continuously purchasing
              green products from such stores or investing in them, we will gradually build an image of a green future,
              giving them confidence in the future.

            <p>
              After entering the test, we listed several goals to measure our success. From the user test, we will see
              whether our service is easy to use, easy to use or easy to understand, and use the results to improve our
              content. , and finally we also hope to measure the feasibility of our services through competitive product
              analysis.

              However, our testing time was less than a week, and we could only draw out the cocoons from a few samples.
              There were very few projects that could be achieved, which meant that there was a lot of room for
              optimization.

          <p>This project allowed us to fully experience the service design process. They all have rich work experience
            and their cooperation focuses more on practicality and rationality.
          </p>

          <p>TI was very impressed by their ability to process data and reconcile differences during the process. I
            learned a lot of skills in working with the design team from them. We often asked during discussions whether
            the argument was based on data or assumptions, and some team members also Always bring us back on track and
            pay attention to time control when we are diverging ideas.

          <p>
            Finally, I think I should improve my report presentation skills. I made a lot of preparations but my mind
            went blank after I took the stage. I was quite disappointed with myself. However, after this blow, I began
            to actively seek help and improvement. I hope that I will be more prepared for typhoons and content in the
            future, and I will have the confidence to meditate on everything I have learned.
