          <h3>1. Research</h3>
          <p>
            As a Taiwanese, I‚Äôm surprise that pension statements are quite different. In the UK, the National pension
            and workplace pensions are calculated separately. Typically, residents who pay taxes regularly are provided
            with a dedicated account by the government. Pension generated from National Insurance base on the rate of
            contribution (similar to Taiwan‚Äôs labor pension).
          </p>
          <p>
            Work pension are from pension providers commit by employers with a account. In other words, changing
            companies would having a new pension account. A portion of salary is already contributed would give the
            money after retirement as pension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pension providers not only manage pensions but also offer wealth management service. People can invest in
            various funds such as the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) financial products through them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, private pension is people can save their pension in the institution they trust. This is
            well-fit for freelancers or individuals who want to increase their savings.

            Climate Change and Sustainability
          </p>
          <p>
            Reducing carbon footprint has been a key strategy for countries to address climate change. Recently, carbon
            trading policies have also been implemented. Although everything is still in the early stages, comprehensive
            measures will soon be in place to limit carbon emissions from individuals and industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the policy and economic front, data shows that the returns on green investments now exceed those of
            traditional investment projects. These investments are regulated for financial transparency by the Financial
            Conduct Authority (FCA).
          </p>
          <p>
            However‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p>
            We found that while people are familiar with these terms, they lack actionable knowledge. They are unable to
            grasp the future implications of carbon footprint on climate change. Despite the roll-out of policies, there
            has been limited public attention to this issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reducing carbon footprints has always been a strategy that nations are committed to improving climate
            change. Although, carbon credit policies are in starting stage, there will soon be a complete set of
            measures to restrict industries and people from reducing carbon emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of policies and economics, green funds prove to be more profitable than traditional investments, a
            fact reinforced by the regular oversight of fiscal transparency by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
          </p>
          <p>
            BUT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people know what ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù means but are unsure what to do. They are unable to care about the
            future arc of the impact of carbon footprint on climate change. Although policies have been introduced one
            after another, they have never attracted the attention of the general public.

          </h5>
          <p>
            According to data provided by local retirement agencies and insurance companies, people usually start
            retirement plans at the age of 36 which falls squarely within the category of the Millennial generation
            (30‚Äì39 years old).
          </p>
          <p>
            We list some problems of MillennialÔºö

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lack of pension literacy
            </li>
            <li>
              Care about the amount of pension, but no interest in investment profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only few people have read annual report from pension provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand the importance of green investment, But I don‚Äôt see any benefits or risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rate of contribution for work pension affects engagement.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Hypothesis
          </h4>
          <p>
            We‚Äôve identified some of the main reasons why people are reluctant to plan for retirement:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lack of pension literacy
            </li>
            <li>Difficulties in knowledge exchange</li>
            <li>Unable to make any decisions about retirement</li>
            <li>Don‚Äôt see any benefit from ESG investing</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Interview</h4>
          <p>
            We focused our interviews on high-potential Millennial's, whom research shows are those who have work
            experience, have retirement accounts and are likely to continue working for more than 25 years. We asked
            more than ten Millennial's to share their experiences and selected five to conduct an in-depth survey of
            their behaviors and thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results are summarized into the following three points:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uncertainty about the future<br>
              We found that a large volume of people‚Äôs refusal to participate in retirement planning is due to a desire
              to escape fear of the future.</li>
            <li>High financial literacy ‚â† Understand pension<br>
              Even if the interviewees work in the financial industry and are full of financial knowledge, it does not
              mean that they will want to actively save for retirement.</li>
            <li>Distrust of the pension system<br>
              People don‚Äôt know enough about pensions, let alone understand that investing their pensions in ESG
              products will bring them better benefits.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In summary, people are more tend to manage their finances in the present rather than contemplating
            retirement.

            After having the above survey data, we started brainstorming, collecting everyone‚Äôs opinions, rating the
            value to users and the sense of security in the future, and filtered out the solution that best suited both.

              Our product is called Teller, and the idea is that we can help users map their future by taking control of
              their retirement savings and investments.

            <h4>Our Service Process</h4>
            <p>
              Teller uses Round-up to allow consumers to round up the payment price difference when consuming and put
              the price difference into their pension account. For example, if a consumer buys a cup of coffee for ¬£2.5,
              the payment will be ¬£3, and the extra ¬£0.5 will be Put it into your retirement account as a pension.
            </p>
            <p>
              We limit this function to only stores that are beneficial to climate change. By continuously purchasing
              green products from such stores or investing in them, we will gradually build an image of a green future,
              giving them confidence in the future.

            <h4>User and target testing</h4>
            <p>
              After entering the test, we listed several goals to measure our success. From the user test, we will see
              whether our service is easy to use, easy to use or easy to understand, and use the results to improve our
              content. , and finally we also hope to measure the feasibility of our services through competitive product
              analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, our testing time was less than a week, and we could only draw out the cocoons from a few samples.
              There were very few projects that could be achieved, which meant that there was a lot of room for
              optimization.

          <h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
          <p>This project allowed us to fully experience the service design process. They all have rich work experience
            and their cooperation focuses more on practicality and rationality.
          </p>

          <p>TI was very impressed by their ability to process data and reconcile differences during the process. I
            learned a lot of skills in working with the design team from them. We often asked during discussions whether
            the argument was based on data or assumptions, and some team members also Always bring us back on track and
            pay attention to time control when we are diverging ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I think I should improve my report presentation skills. I made a lot of preparations but my mind
            went blank after I took the stage. I was quite disappointed with myself. However, after this blow, I began
            to actively seek help and improvement. I hope that I will be more prepared for typhoons and content in the
            future, and I will have the confidence to meditate on everything I have learned.
