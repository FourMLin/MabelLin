              <p>HoloTile is a holographic ornament that helps people communicate. It can be an icebreaker when people
                having a hard time talking with someone close.

          <h4>Communication conflicts</h4>
          <p>
            Filial piety to parents has always been an important family culture in Chinese society.
            Increase the bond in members and also cause constraints. Conflicts between parents and children are always
            impossible to communicate with each other because of identity. Even more, the generation gap in between has
            deepened conflict. I want to fill the gap between parents and children from the experience of myself, my
            friends and someone else's stories.

          </p>
          <h4>Result of 200 quastionare</h4>
          <p>
            In average, most people want to solve the problem when conflict happened.

          <h4>Everyone need a chance</h4>
          <p>In conclusion, people can share positive emotions with their parents without thinking. But when there is a
            negative feeling or conflict between them, many people are overwhelmed and even ignore it. Quite a lot of
            people are actually willing to express their opinions when they are emotional. They just need an opportunity
            to open their mind.</p>

          <h3>Idea of HoloTile</h3>
          <h4>Holographic display</h4>
          <p>
            <i>“The HYPERVSN holographic display a four-ray rotor that spins fast at a speed of 670 RPM. Your eyes won’t see any rays though, only your stunning 3D content floating in mid-air.”  -- HYPERVSN website</i>

          <h4>Majolica Tile in Taiwan</h4>
          <p>
            The tiles in Taiwan are imported products from Japan which is  imitates the production methods and patterns of the United Kingdom. These tiles are pasted on the outside of buildings to show  the owner's not only symbolizing wealth but also the patterns on the tiles represent blessings.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the results of simulation experiments, if the battery and magnet can theoretically be reduced
            and put into the base. The tile part is a holographic fan, and a magnet is placed in the center.
            Magnetically-generated electricity powers holographic fans.

          <h3>Express the fellings to people</h3>
          <p>
            At first, I wanted to express unspeakable emotions to my parents through the product. Later, I found that my
            parents would keep the letters I wrote as souvenirs. I even found that not only parents but also friends and
            lovers can also use holographic snow to convey their minds to each other. Asians are always reluctant to
            express themselves due to various reasons. I hope that Holograph Snow can be used as an intermediary to open
            communication, so that everyone can bravely express themselves without regret.
