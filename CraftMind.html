              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>
                Fraud is a serious problem in the UK and all around the world. According to BDO’s investigation and Fraud and Cyber ​​Crime report, a total of £2.3 billion was lost to fraud in the past 13 months. More than 70% are fraud traps that lead to information theft. These horrific figures account for less than one-seventh of the total, representing many more potential victims.

          <h4>How's the fraud happen?</h4>
            <p>
              Fraud is the crisis of trust. Scammers use this trust to make promises, and once they gain access to a person’s property, they disappear. Modern fraud techniques are becoming complicated, but they still fundamentally rely on building a reputable image to win trust. Scammers might pretend as your financial advisor, spiritual guide, or a prospective employer. They invade people's life by using their desires and aspirations.

            <h4>Why being scammed?</h4>
            <p>
              Through desk research and collecting stories from individuals, I found that educating people to prevent fraud has limited effectiveness because scams are highly customized and we can’t make people always suspect others. Many people believe that falling victim only affects the elderly. In reality, people under 35 have five times more risk than people over 55. Because of their overconfidence and the strong belief that they won’t be targeted by scammers.

          <h4>Prototype</h4>
          <p>I developed two prototypes to test people's feelings of risk. The first version is a risk prediction tool designed to detect the credibility of money recipients and provide timely alerts. It shows potential fraud types they may encounter based on users' consumption habits in their bank accounts. The second version, named Naivitor, generates a naivety level by evaluating indicators such as persuasiveness, logic, anxiety, and social connection. This score helps to tailor a user's security level and adjust it over time.</p>

            <img src="img/cm-6.png" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>The result in the risk prediction, people expressed that consumption warnings might be useful but they were concerned about whether they had made a mistake to deserve this and they lacked motivation to check the prediction. As for the feedback on Naivitor, users found questions linking real-life is easy to engage in and dynamic verification questions will reduce the burden of transactions. But they worry about the over-judgment of people and about giving too many rights for service providers to control their lives.</p>

          <h4>Attention curve</h4>
          <p>During testing and data collection, I discovered that people's attention to events like this curve. When individuals receive new information, their attention is initially high, after some times, it becomes difficult for them to maintain attention and they lose interest. However, there is a group of people, represented by the yellow dashed line, who may not have high attention but consistently make an effort to keep themselves and others pay attention.</p>
