          <h3>Interview</h3>
          <h4>How’s the online insurance tool do?</h4>
          <p>
            According to interviews, many people grew up with insurance arranged by their parents. They can't learn
            insurance knowledge from past experiences because it has totally different policies. In Taiwan, the morality
            and professionalism of insurance solicitors are generally questioned, so that many young people want to
            understand their needs before purchasing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project is to teach users who need insurance to increase their knowledge of insurance
            and help them calculate the insurance premium they have to prepare through the information released on the
            Internet. In addition, these tools can increase the professionalism of the insurance solicitors in the
            company. It uses online tools to assist in business training, which can quickly gain insight of customer
            needs and give advice during their conversations with customers immediately.

          <h3>Features and structure</h3>
          <h4>Planning</h4>
          <p>
            According to the requirements, we know that there are three things to do: optimize insurance recommendations, add product combinations and add product searches. The latter two are new functions and must be linked with the previous insurance recommendations.
          </p>
          <h4>Structure</h4>
          <h5>Three mainly tools</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Insurance recommendation - Mainly users are the general public. Recommend the policy combinations that have been formed on the website.</li>
            <li>Searcher - Search all policies currently on file on the site.</li>
            <li>Insurance combination - 
              Mainly users are insurance solictors. It is the function of freely combining insurance policies.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The three tools will eventually connect to each other and assist insurance solictors in the business process.</p>
          <h5>Flow chart</h5>

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <h4>8 Insurance solictors test record</h4>
          <p>
            We conduct internal insurance solicitors tests and ask them to provide us with the database and problems
            encountered in the process. We even conduct A/B tests on the website to track customers' usage habits, and
            finally optimize the website according to the results. When encountering database errors, the process is
            interrupted, and the inability to leave orders conflicts with financial laws, we ask these financial experts
            to tell us the current processes and regulations. We hope that the product can be cut into their processes
            to facilitate them to analyze customers.
          </p>
          <h4>Workshop</h4>
          <div class="imgs_flex">
            <p class="imgs_left">
              In addition, we interviewed general customers and talked about their problems with online insurance for
              life insurance and health insurance. Most of them are still unfamiliar with online insurance. Although
              everyone is used to web inquiries, they still rely on the instructions of insurance personnel, resulting
              in some people being insured. Too much insurance is not necessarily helpful.

            <p>This is the outpost function of an electronic insurance policy. The company wants to develop the
              insurance business into efficient professional risk management experts, not just the business of selling
              insurance. I have been away from this company for a long time. Looking at the current website is a little
              different from the original plan, but the concept is still there. This is a very good experience for me,
              which benefits me to gain a lot in the complex financial field.</p>
