              <p>The publishing industry has been in decline in modern times. It has a more pronounced impact on local
                authors in this small-market place. We can't imitate the personnel assignment in the large market. so I
                make the most essential processes into a service.

          <h4>Vicious circle of novel publish</h4>
          <p>
            Author rely on submissions and winning literary competitions. Submission is difficult for an amateur who can
            not gain favour from the overloaded publisher. Literary competitions In Taiwan, apart from pure literature,
            novel competitions are fading the enthusiasm of many amateur writers . This phenomenon has caused no new
            writers to get a foot in the door and the industry of publishing without possibility of progress. The uneven
            quality of the novel makes it even less popular among readers.

          <h4>Diversity self-publish</h4>
          <p>
            Today, there are many digital platforms such as Pubu, Readmoo, Amazon Kindle, Kobo etc, that provide direct
            publishing services. Many authors can benefit from these services and publish e-books and physical books
            concurrently. After 2020, the proportion of e-books reading gradually increases due to the impact of the
            pandemic. It makes the digital publishing service more optimistic.

            The map shows the content provider and receiver as the main direct stakeholder. As an indirect stakeholder
            we have book makers and marketing requirements. Advertisers and booksellers also cooperate with platforms
            and publishers to achieve promotion goals.

          <h4>Article Streaming</h4>
          <p>
            Legal paid streaming provides works on the service platform. With a reasonable monthly fee, users can read a large amount of genuine authorized content. It can stop piracy and satisfy consumers that they do not want to spend too much money.
          </p>
          <h4>Co-creation</h4>
          <p>
            Derivative creation and originality represents the two-way-simultaneous interaction between readers and authors. The distance between each other is shortened, making the author have a more affinity with the stories they create.
          </p>
          <h4>Copyright co-ownership</h4>
          <p>
            The concept of decentralization allows multiple users to own part of the copyright by paying fees. This may allow unpublished but anticipated authors to have alternative sponsorship plans. It may also allow publishers to increase benefits in this way.
